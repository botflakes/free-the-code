        <h2><span class="emoji">📌</span> The Issue</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Elegoo Centauri Carbon</strong> 3D printer uses a heavily
          modified version of <a href="https://www.klipper3d.org/">Klipper</a>
          firmware, specifically based on a commit <code>616 commits past v0.9.1 (shorthash 28f60f7e)</code>.
          Klipper is licensed under <strong>GPL-3.0</strong>, which legally
          requires all modifications to be made publicly available.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
          <strong>Why this matters:</strong> GPL compliance isn't optional—it's
          a legal requirement. When companies use open-source software, they
          must respect the licenses. This ensures transparency, security, and
          the right for users to modify and improve their own devices.
        </div>

        <div class="warning">
          <strong>Current Status:</strong> Despite clear evidence and community
          pressure since August 7, 2025, Elegoo has only provided generic
          support responses stating the issue is "under review by R&D."
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="glass-card" id="evidence">
        <h2><span class="emoji">🔍</span> Technical Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          Community investigation by user <strong>Sims (HACC)</strong> revealed
          multiple pieces of evidence through detailed binary analysis:
        </p>

        <h4>DSP MCU Firmware Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          The DSP (part of Allwinner SoC) uses Xtensa architecture and runs as the mainboard MCU.
          Binary analysis shows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear Klipper MCU code paths in the DSP firmware</li>
          <li>Xtensa architecture not supported by mainline Klipper—proving custom modifications</li>
          <li>Firmware is not stripped, allowing detailed reverse engineering</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Bed MCU Firmware</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Contains commands not present in mainline Klipper</li>
          <li>Mainline Klipper can connect but shuts down due to version mismatch</li>
          <li>Reveals exact commit: <code>616 commits past v0.9.1 (shorthash 28f60f7e)</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Host Software Analysis</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Main application at <code>/app/app</code> is written in C++</li>
          <li>Contains transpiled Python code from Klipper's Klippy host</li>
          <li>Original references to Klippy remain intact in the C++ version</li>
          <li>Includes components like <code>mem_interface_DSP</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Embedded Web Server (Mongoose 7.12)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Firmware exposes an HTTP service identifying as <code>Mongoose/7.12</code> (embedded web server).</li>
          <li>Mongoose 7.12 requires a commercial license to be able to distribute it without publishing code, which ELEGOO does not have.</li>
          <li>If no commercial license was obtained, this is a separate license violation in addition to any GPL obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Network Traffic Investigation</h4>
        <p>
          Community members investigated excessive network usage:
        </p>
        <p>For more details, see the <a href="#traffic-note">note below</a>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Printer generates 70GB+ of traffic per month while idle</li>
          <li>Health checks ping servers 10+ times per minute</li>
          <li>Traffic analysis shows connections to Apple servers</li>
          <li>Responsible for 29.5% of household network traffic while idle</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info">
          <strong>Technical Note:</strong> While open-sourcing may be challenging due to
          Allwinner and Chitu involvement, other manufacturers like Creality
          have solved this by releasing source code alongside binary blobs for
          proprietary components.
        </div>

        <div class="warning">
          <strong>Security Concern:</strong> Running known out-of-date open-source software
          without access to security patches creates significant risks for botnet exploitation.

        <h2><span class="emoji">🏢</span> Industry Context</h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, Elegoo isn't alone in problematic practices. Some vendors have
          GPL compliance issues; others impose ecosystem restrictions (not GPL violations):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Anycubic:</strong> KobraOS on 2.x and 3.x series violates
            GPL on multiple libraries including Klipper
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chitu-supplied platforms:</strong> Shared firmware stacks used across brands (e.g., Anycubic; some Creality models historically) have, in some cases, resulted in distributions missing the corresponding source for modified GPL components. Supplier contracts do not remove the distributor’s GPL obligations (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPL‑3.0</a>). Chitu Systems' firmware and hardware are proprietary, which can constrain user modification and repairability (<a href="https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/chitu-systems-and-chitubox-a-lesson-in-fighting-open-source-3d-printing-194783/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">context</a>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Historical cases:</strong> Community reports cite GPL gaps on specific models (e.g., Creality CR‑X), while other products later published sources (e.g., Creality K1 series).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marlin/Linux derivatives:</strong> Some vendors have shipped modified Marlin, Linux kernels, or Entware without timely source publication. GPL‑3.0 requires providing complete corresponding source to users of the binaries.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
          <strong>The Solution:</strong> The 3D printing community needs to
          hold manufacturers accountable. GPL violations harm innovation,
          security, and user rights across the entire ecosystem.
        </div>

        <div class="info">
          <strong>Vendor statement:</strong> “No, the ELEGOO OS is not based on Klipper. The Klipper solution uses a dual-chip setup, consisting of an SOC + MCU, whereas the Centauri Carbon’s hardware architecture uses only one chip. Currently, it is not compatible with open-source Klipper commands or some open-source plugins, such as Fluidd.” (Hackster, Feb 17 2025) (<a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/elegoo-centauri-carbon-3d-printer-review-c57caab085e1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>). This page aggregates community technical indicators of Klipper‑based components and modifications. If confirmed, GPL‑3.0 requires providing the complete corresponding source to users of the distributed binaries (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPL‑3.0</a>).

        <h2><span class="emoji">⚖️</span> Legal and Policy Points</h2>
        <p>
          Recent discussion clarified several important GPL topics and consumer options:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Binary blobs vs. GPL‑3.0:</strong> Linux allows some blobs under GPL‑2.0 with exceptions; GPL‑3.0 requires complete corresponding source for modified GPL components. A blob cannot replace modified Klipper source.</li>
          <li><strong>Why compliance matters:</strong> If a vendor cannot publish changes due to third‑party contracts (e.g., Allwinner), they should not have used GPL code. Non‑compliance voids distribution rights.</li>
          <li><strong>Fraud and consumer protection:</strong> Misrepresentations (e.g., denying Klipper use) may create consumer fraud exposure; some users consider FTC/state reports.</li>
          <li><strong>Chargebacks (use cautiously):</strong> Some banks may accept disputes for deceptive practices. Risk: loss of support or future purchases.</li>
          <li><strong>International enforcement:</strong> GPL has seen international enforcement, including in China. For imported hardware, U.S. courts can issue border injunctions.</li>
          <li><strong>Chitu involvement:</strong> Community‑reported analysis suggests Chitu involvement with similarities to Anycubic Kobra 2 Pro (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1n1rlmc/klipper_on_the_centauri_carbon_i_need_your_help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community analysis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenCentauri/OpenCentauri/tree/main/serial-multiplexer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo</a>). Where possible, prefer primary evidence (firmware strings/diffs, vendor docs). This informs where to direct compliance requests.</li>
          <li><strong>Mongoose 7.x licensing:</strong> The Cesanta Mongoose embedded web server (v7.x) requires a commercial license for proprietary firmware; using it without one would be a separate license violation. Not to be confused with <a href="https://mongoose-os.com/licensing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mongoose OS</a> (a different product with a Community Edition under Apache‑2.0). See <a href="https://mongoose.ws/licensing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensing</a>.</li>

Subject: Request for GPL Compliance – Centauri Carbon Firmware

Dear Elegoo Support Team,

I am writing regarding the Elegoo Centauri Carbon 3D printer and its firmware's GPL compliance obligations.

BACKGROUND:
It has been conclusively determined that the Centauri Carbon firmware is based on Klipper (commit 616 past v0.9.1, shorthash 28f60f7e), which is licensed under GPL-3.0. Community analysis has revealed:

• Modified DSP MCU firmware with Klipper code paths
• Custom bed MCU firmware with non-standard commands  
• Transpiled Klippy host code (Python to C++) with original references intact
• Version strings that confirm the exact Klipper commit used

LEGAL REQUIREMENT:
Under GPL-3.0, all modifications to licensed code must be made available to users. This is not a request—it is a legal obligation that applies regardless of business preferences or technical challenges.

REQUEST:
I respectfully but firmly request that Elegoo immediately release the complete modified source code for:

1. DSP MCU firmware (Xtensa architecture modifications)
2. Bed MCU firmware with custom commands
3. Host-side Klippy code (C++ transpiled version)
4. Any other GPL-licensed components used in the system

PRECEDENT:
Other manufacturers like Creality have successfully handled similar situations by releasing source code alongside binary blobs for proprietary components where necessary.

I expect a concrete timeline for source code release, not generic "under review" responses. The 3D printing community is watching how Elegoo handles this legitimate compliance request.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this legal matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
